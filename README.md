##  Project Description
Our app is designed for groups of friends traveling together. It helps manage and share expenses easily, ensuring that no one has to worry about splitting bills manually. Users can upload receipts and choose who among their travel companions will split the cost. The app then calculates and tracks the shared expenses, ensuring that everyone pays their fair share. Whether it's for meals, tickets, or accommodations, this tool simplifies group travel expenses so travelers can focus on the fun, not the finances.
